# Agent Notes — Game Designer

Vision
- A calm, cohesive web playground featuring small, modular games with instant load, quick feedback loops, and low friction. Visual language is clean, readable, and slightly playful.

Design Pillars
- Instant iteration: fast restarts, short loops, small levels.
- Clarity over complexity: minimalist visuals, clear affordances, high contrast.
- Tactile feedback: subtle animations and lightweight sound where appropriate.
- Accessibility: keyboard support and readable UI across themes.

Games Overview
- Memory (Classic): Match pairs; track time and moves; escalate board sizes. Ideal for quick sessions.
- Checkers (Classic + AI): Local two‑player or adaptive AI (Lv 1–5). Forced capture, kinging, stalemate detection.
- Tiny Utopia (Experimental): Idle sandbox; nudge plants/animals/water toward “Harmony.” Ambient audio and trends.
- Backspace (Experimental): Rewind to spawn ghosts that retrace paths; use them to hold switches and open doors.

Tone & Aesthetics
- Minimalist shapes, soft gradients, limited palette. Background uses gentle animated blobs for playfulness.
- Keep motion subtle; respect reduced‑motion preferences.
- Use emoji sparingly to add charm (Memory symbols, Tiny Utopia animals).

UX Guidelines
- Topbar: concise title + essential controls (theme, restart, opponent/level where relevant).
- HUD: 3–5 key stats; avoid clutter. Show trends or bests to drive engagement.
- Feedback: positive microcopy (“Match! ✅”, “Serene”), small pulses/glows, short sounds.
- Modals: keep copy short; offer Restart/Next options.

Balancing & Progression
- Memory: default 4×4; add 6×6. Consider timed modes or streak bonuses later.
- Checkers: start with Lv 1 AI; auto-tune difficulty post-match (±1). Offer manual override in future.
- Tiny Utopia: keep dynamics gentle; harmony > 0.8 should feel “Serene.” Add goals (“Maintain 70%+ for 60s”).
- Backspace: small handcrafted levels; each introduces a concept. Keep solutions 1–3 clever steps.

Content Guidelines
- Levels: favor short, teachable challenges. A puzzle should be solvable in under a minute once understood.
- Audio: naturalistic and light. Provide mute and remember preference.
- Theme: dark/light parity. Ensure genre badges and HUD remain readable.

Future Ideas
- Memory: daily challenge seed; combos for quick consecutive matches.
- Checkers: multi-jump sequences, openings explorer, timed mode.
- Tiny Utopia: events (rainy/dry seasons), visitors, artifacts that bend rules.
- Backspace: one‑screen levels, level select, in‑browser editor (text grid + tileset legend).

Playtesting Notes
- Observe first‑run: does the player understand controls in 10 seconds?
- Can players recover quickly (restart, undo, rewind) without friction?
- Do sounds feel pleasant and never overwhelming?
